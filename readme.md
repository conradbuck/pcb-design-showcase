#PCB Design Showcase

This is a collection of the PCBs I have designed for various clients using KiCAD.
- I have designed PCBs with Altium, but KiCAD is just easier

These PCBs help my clients make the first prototype of their product which they can then present to investors to help explain their product.


- system design, making sure that the prototype is capable of all necessary features
- component selection, selecting specific MCUs or passives based on economical and time constraints
- targeted package PCB design, designing the PCB so it is compatible with the envisioned design of the founder
- manufacturing and assembly, selecting optimal settings and components through the JLCPCB website and having the final product shipped directly to the founder
- firmware, I write the necessary firmware to get the product fuunctional, see "hardware-control" repo for samples of code I have written for small hardware gadgets
- casing design, I design functional casings for PCBs to close the product development loop

Please direct design inquires to my email: conrad.buck@berkeley.edu
